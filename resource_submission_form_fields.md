**How to fill it:** Enter DOIs for all publications the software is cited in. If DOI not available, enter citation in APA format with permanent link (e.g., Shaifullah, G., Tiburzi, C., & Zucca, P. (2020) CMEchaser, Detecting Line-of-Sight Occultations Due to Coronal Mass Ejections Solar Physics, 295(10), 136. https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.12153).

---

### 28. Related Datasets (OPTIONAL)
**Type:** Multi-entry DataCite DOI

**What it is:** Datasets the software supports functionality for (e.g., analysis).

**How to fill it:** At minimum, the DOI should be the publication that described the dataset. If DOI not available, enter citation in APA format (e.g., Fuselier et al. (2022). MMS 4 Hot Plasma Composition Analyzer (HPCA) Ions, Level 2 (L2), Burst Mode, 0.625 s Data [Data set]. NASA Space Physics Data Facility. https://hpde.io/NASA/NumericalData/MMS/4/HotPlasmaCompositionAnalyzer/Burst/Level2/Ion/PT0.625S.html).

---

### 29. Related Software (OPTIONAL)
**Type:** Multi-entry DataCite DOI

**What it is:** Software that performs similar tasks but does not necessarily link together (which would be 'interoperable software'). Important software dependencies and software this work was forked from should also be included.

**How to fill it:** Ideally, enter the DOI for the software code. Otherwise, link to code repository (e.g., https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy). If no public repository, enter link where users can find more information (e.g., related HSSI item). Publication DOIs should go in relatedPublications instead.

---

### 30. Interoperable Software (OPTIONAL)
**Type:** Multi-entry DataCite DOI

**What it is:** Other important software packages this software has demonstrated interoperability with. Can run package in the same environment as the others without errors.

**How to fill it:** Ideally, enter the DOI for the software code. Otherwise, link to code repository (e.g., https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy). If no public repository, enter link where users can find more information (e.g., related HSSI page). Publication DOIs should go in relatedPublications instead.

---

### 31. Related Instruments (OPTIONAL)
**Type:** Multi-entry nested group

**What it is:** The instrument the software is designed to support.

**When to include it (relevance):** List an instrument only if the software is *designed to support* it — it directly reads/writes/parses/calibrates/processes that specific instrument's data, implements a data format/convention specific to it (as a means of supporting it), is purpose-built or an instrument-team tool for it, or models/visualizes its measurements as a primary function. Sanity check: would a user searching HSSI for `instrument:"X"`, or someone working with X's data, expect this software back? If not, leave it out. **Exclude** instrument-agnostic tools (general models/utilities/frameworks support none specifically), tutorial/demo/example name-drops, "configurable for" / "commonly used with" / "optimized for" mentions of an otherwise-agnostic tool, and links that belong to another field — **generic** support for a multi-instrument *file format* (FITS/CDF/netCDF) → Input/Output File Formats, or a **generic/multi-mission** *data archive/source* (e.g. CDAWeb broadly) → Data Sources. **But** an instrument-**specific** parser, format, convention, or data source/API *does* count as designed-to-support — list that instrument here. Note: an instrument the software genuinely supports but that isn't in the controlled vocabulary yet is still *related* — flag it for review rather than dropping it.

**How to fill it:** Begin typing the instrument name. Matches from HSSI's controlled instrument/observatory vocabulary appear in the dropdown; choose the correct one. This vocabulary is sourced from the heliophysics.net API and resolved to SPASE identifiers (it replaced the older IVOA-based list, which is now retired). If no entry matches, type the full name.

**Agent guidance:** Resolve the instrument against the controlled list at `/api/models/InstrumentObservatory/rows/all/` (fetch the ~7,700-row list once to a file and filter locally; don't load it all into context). **Every row is SPASE-backed** — each `identifier` is a `https://spase-metadata.org/...` URL; `identifier.startswith("https://spase-metadata.org/")` is fine as a cheap sanity guard but no longer filters anything out. Match by `type` 1 (instrument), comparing against the row `name`, its `abbreviation`, source parenthetical aliases, and the SPASE identifier path segments (repos often mention only an acronym like `MFI`/`AIA`); prefer `SMWG/...` only as a tie-breaker among same-name duplicates, and treat `.html` and bare identifiers as the same resource (prefer the bare one). **If more than one SPASE candidate remains, or no row matches exactly but the vocab still has a plausible same-type row for that name (case-insensitive/trimmed, or an obvious parenthetical-abbreviation variant), do not emit a bare name — omit the entry and flag it for manual review.** The no-identifier path `filter(name, type).first()` binds a bare name to an arbitrary same-name row or creates a near-duplicate SPASE row from name drift. A bare `name` is safe **only** when the vocab has zero plausible `name`+`type` matches. Otherwise supply the matched row's canonical `name` (verbatim) + its SPASE `identifier` (the reliable de-duplication key — a free-typed or abbreviation-embedded name silently creates a duplicate). See the `submission-payload` / `update-payload` skills for the authoritative procedure.

**Sub-fields:**
- **Instrument Name** (OPTIONAL): Name of the instrument — the matched controlled-list row's `name`, copied verbatim
- **Instrument Identifier** (OPTIONAL): Globally unique persistent identifier — for controlled-list resolution this is the SPASE Resource ID URL from the list (e.g. `https://spase-metadata.org/SMWG/Instrument/...`). A human may supply a DOI as a manual exception, but **agents must not substitute a DOI to satisfy controlled-list resolution**: resolve to SPASE. If there is no exact match, only free-type the bare name when **no** row plausibly matches that `name`+`type`; if an exact or plausible same-type row exists, omit the entry and flag it for manual review instead (a genuine repo-provided instrument DOI may be recorded but noted as out-of-vocab). Enables improved linking and reliable matching.

---

### 32. Related Observatories (OPTIONAL)
**Type:** Multi-entry nested group

**What it is:** The mission, observatory, and/or group of instruments the software is designed to support.

**When to include it (relevance):** List a mission/observatory only if the software is *designed to support* it — it directly works with that observatory's/mission's data or data products, implements its data conventions, is purpose-built or a mission-team tool for it, or models/visualizes its measurements as a primary function. Sanity check: would a user searching HSSI for `observatory:"X"`, or a scientist working with X's data, expect this software back? If not, leave it out. **Exclude** observatory-agnostic tools (general models/utilities support none specifically), tutorial/demo/example name-drops and "platforms you *could* support," "configurable for a location/observatory" general tools, and links that belong to another field — a **generic/multi-mission** *data archive/source* (e.g. CDAWeb broadly) → Data Sources, or a generic *file convention* → Input/Output File Formats. **But** if the software directly supports a **specific named mission's** data — including via that mission's own archive, API, or format — that mission *is* designed-to-support: list it here **and** mark the source `observatory-specific` in Data Sources (Field 17 already instructs this cross-listing). A mission/observatory the software genuinely supports but that isn't in the controlled vocabulary yet is still *related* — flag it for review rather than dropping it.

**How to fill it:** Begin typing the name. Matches from HSSI's controlled instrument/observatory vocabulary appear in the dropdown; choose the correct one. This vocabulary is sourced from the heliophysics.net API and resolved to SPASE identifiers (it replaced the older IVOA-based list, which is now retired). If no entry matches, type the full name.

**Agent guidance:** Resolve the observatory/mission against the controlled list at `/api/models/InstrumentObservatory/rows/all/` (fetch the ~7,700-row list once to a file and filter locally; don't load it all into context). **Every row is SPASE-backed** — each `identifier` is a `https://spase-metadata.org/...` URL; `identifier.startswith("https://spase-metadata.org/")` is fine as a cheap sanity guard but no longer filters anything out. Match by `type` 2 (observatory), comparing against the row `name`, its `abbreviation`, source parenthetical aliases (repos often mention only `PSP`/`MMS`), and the SPASE identifier path segments; treat `.html` and bare identifiers as the same resource (prefer the bare one). Prefer the `SMWG/Observatory/...` namespace only as a tie-breaker among same-name duplicates — a single non-SMWG match is still correct (e.g. Solar Orbiter is `ESA/Observatory/SolarOrbiter`); note the canonical SMWG name may be the long form (e.g. SMWG/Observatory/THEMIS is "Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms"). **If more than one SPASE candidate remains, or no row matches exactly but the vocab still has a plausible same-type row for that name (case-insensitive/trimmed, or an obvious parenthetical-abbreviation variant), do not emit a bare name — omit the entry and flag it for manual review.** The no-identifier path `filter(name, type).first()` binds a bare name to an arbitrary same-name row or creates a near-duplicate SPASE row from name drift. A bare `name` is safe **only** when the vocab has zero plausible `name`+`type` matches. Otherwise supply the matched row's canonical `name` (verbatim) + its SPASE `identifier` (the reliable de-duplication key). See the `submission-payload` / `update-payload` skills for the authoritative procedure.

**Sub-fields:**
- **Observatory Name** (OPTIONAL): Name of the observatory/mission — the matched controlled-list row's `name`, copied verbatim
- **Observatory Identifier** (OPTIONAL): Globally unique persistent identifier — the SPASE Resource ID URL from the controlled list (e.g. `https://spase-metadata.org/SMWG/Observatory/...`). Enables improved linking and reliable matching.

## Agreement

### Metadata Agreement (MANDATORY)
Before submission, you must agree to the following terms:

"By submitting this form, you acknowledge and agree that any metadata you provide is submitted voluntarily and becomes part of the public domain. You waive all rights, claims, and interests to the submitted metadata, and grant unrestricted use, reproduction, modification, and distribution rights to the receiving party or its designees."

---

## Automated Metadata Extraction

The HSSI web form supports automated metadata extraction through a cascade of API calls. AI agents can replicate this behavior to pre-fill many form fields automatically.

### Autofill Cascade Overview

The form uses a three-stage cascade when a DOI is provided:

1. **DataCite API** → Extract basic metadata from the DOI
2. **Zenodo API** (if applicable) → Get additional version and repository information
3. **SoMEF** → If a code repository URL was found, extract metadata directly from the repository

Each stage adds more metadata, with later stages filling in gaps or providing more detailed information.

---

- **Version PID** (from `doi`) - The DOI for this specific version
- **Code Repository URL** (from `metadata.custom["code:codeRepository"]` - alternative source)
- **Development Status** (from `metadata.custom["code:developmentStatus"]`)
- **Programming Languages** (from `metadata.custom["code:programmingLanguage"][]`)

**How to replicate:**
```bash
# Extract Zenodo record ID from DOI
RECORD_ID=$(echo "10.5281/zenodo.13287868" | grep -oP 'zenodo\.\K\d+')

# Query Zenodo API
curl "https://zenodo.org/api/records/${RECORD_ID}"
```

### Stage 3: SoMEF (Conditional)

**When to use:** If a code repository URL was found in Stage 1 or Stage 2

**Tool:** [SoMEF](https://github.com/KnowledgeCaptureAndDiscovery/somef) (Software Metadata Extraction Framework)

**Installation:**
```bash
pip install somef
```

**Command:**
```bash
somef describe -t 0.7 -r {REPOSITORY_URL} -o output.json
```

**Fields Extracted:**
- **Persistent Identifier** (from `identifier[].result.value`)
- **Authors** with names and URLs (from `authors[].result`)
- **Software Name** (from `full_title[].result.value` or `name[].result.value`, choosing highest confidence)
- **Description** (from `description[].result.value`, may combine multiple with similar confidence)
- **Publication Date** (from `date_created[].result.value`)
- **Version Number** (from `version[].result.value`, choosing newest version)
- **Version Date** (from `date_updated[].result.value`)
- **Programming Languages** (from `programming_languages[].result.value`)
- **License** (from `license[].result` with `spdx_id` or `name`)
- **Keywords** (from `keywords[].result.value`, comma-separated)
- **Development Status** (from `repository_status[].result.description`)
- **Documentation URL** (from `documentation[].result.value`, prioritizing non-repository domains)
- **Logo** (from `logo[].result.value`)

**Notes:**
- SoMEF uses confidence scores; the implementation chooses results with highest confidence
- SoMEF can be slow (may take 30+ seconds for large repositories)
- The threshold `-t 0.7` means only results with ≥70% confidence are included
- Output format `-o` produces JSON-LD format

**How to replicate:**
```bash
# Example: Extract metadata from a GitHub repository
somef describe -t 0.7 -r https://github.com/SuperDARN/pydarn -o pydarn_metadata.json

# Read the output
cat pydarn_metadata.json
```

### PyHC Package Metadata

**What is PyHC?** The Python in Heliophysics Community (PyHC) maintains a registry of Python packages used in heliophysics research. If the software being submitted is a PyHC package, additional curated metadata may be available.

**PyHC Registry Files:**
PyHC maintains its package registry in three YAML files on GitHub. An AI agent should check all three to determine if the package is registered:

1. **Core packages:** https://github.com/heliophysicsPy/heliophysicsPy.github.io/blob/main/_data/projects_core.yml
2. **Community packages:** https://github.com/heliophysicsPy/heliophysicsPy.github.io/blob/main/_data/projects.yml
3. **Unevaluated packages:** https://github.com/heliophysicsPy/heliophysicsPy.github.io/blob/main/_data/projects_unevaluated.yml

**Fields Available in PyHC Metadata:**
- **name** - Package name
- **description** - Package description
- **logo** - URL to package logo
- **docs** - Documentation URL
- **code** - Code repository URL
- **contact** - Primary contact/maintainer
- **keywords** - Array of keywords (may include domain-specific terms like "ionosphere_thermosphere_mesosphere", "magnetospheres", "solar", etc.)
- **community** - Quality rating for community engagement
- **documentation** - Quality rating for documentation
- **testing** - Quality rating for testing coverage
- **software_maturity** - Quality rating for software maturity
- **python3** - Quality rating for Python 3 compatibility
- **license** - Quality rating for license clarity

**How to check:**

1. **Read all three YAML files completely** - Don't use grep or search for specific terms, as you might use the wrong search term and miss a match
2. **Parse each file** and examine all entries to find matches based on:
   - Package name (may differ slightly from repository name)
   - Repository URL (code field)
   - Package description content
3. If found, extract the metadata from that entry
4. Use PyHC metadata to supplement other sources

**Example approach:**
```bash
# Download all three PyHC registry files for complete analysis
curl -s "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/heliophysicsPy/heliophysicsPy.github.io/main/_data/projects_core.yml" -o pyhc_core.yml
curl -s "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/heliophysicsPy/heliophysicsPy.github.io/main/_data/projects.yml" -o pyhc_community.yml
curl -s "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/heliophysicsPy/heliophysicsPy.github.io/main/_data/projects_unevaluated.yml" -o pyhc_unevaluated.yml

# Then parse each YAML file in its entirety to check for matches
# (Use a YAML parser to read all entries and compare against the package being analyzed)
```

**Important Notes:**
- Not all heliophysics packages are PyHC packages - absence from these files does not indicate a problem
- PyHC metadata is curated by the community and is considered more definitive/accurate than auto-extracted metadata
- The quality ratings (Good, Partially met, etc.) can inform the Development Status field
- PyHC keywords may map to HSSI's Related Region, Software Functionality, or Keywords fields

### Combining Results

The autofill cascade fills form fields in this recommended order:
1. **DataCite API** metadata is applied first
2. **Zenodo API** metadata overwrites/supplements DataCite data
3. **SoMEF** metadata is applied (only if repository URL was found)
4. **PyHC metadata** can supplement/replace any of the above, especially for logo, documentation, and keywords

Later stages generally don't overwrite fields that are already filled, unless the new data is more specific or complete. PyHC metadata, being manually curated, may be prioritized for certain fields like documentation URLs and description.

## Notes for AI Agents

When extracting metadata from a GitHub repository to fill this form:

1. **Code Repository URL** can be found directly from the repository URL
2. **Software Name** is typically in the repository name or README
3. **Description** and **Concise Description** are often in README.md or package metadata
4. **Authors** can be extracted from:
   - CITATION.cff file
   - codemeta.json file
   - AUTHORS file
   - CONTRIBUTORS file
   - Git commit history (with caution)
   - Package metadata (setup.py, package.json, etc.)
5. **License** information is typically in:
   - LICENSE or LICENSE.txt file
   - Package metadata files
   - Repository settings
6. **Programming Language** can be determined from:
   - File extensions in the repository
   - GitHub's language statistics
   - Package configuration files
7. **Reference Publication** tends to be obvious when it exists:
   - CITATION.cff file
   - README recommendations for how to cite the package
8. **Documentation** URL is often in:
   - README.md links
   - docs/ folder
   - .readthedocs.yml or other doc configuration
9. **Version** information may be in:
   - Git tags
   - Release notes
   - Package version files
   - CHANGELOG.md
10. **Keywords** might be found in:
   - Repository topics/tags
   - Package metadata
   - README.md
11. **DOIs** (Persistent Identifier, Version PID, Reference Publication) may be in:
    - CITATION.cff
    - README badges
    - Zenodo integration
    - codemeta.json
12. **Development Status** can be inferred from:
    - Recent commit activity
    - README status badges
    - Repository status indicators
13. **File Formats** supported may be mentioned in:
    - Documentation
    - Code analysis (file I/O operations)
    - README.md feature lists
14. **Operating System** compatibility may be in:
    - CI/CD configuration (.github/workflows, .travis.yml, etc.)
    - Installation documentation
    - Package metadata
15. **Software Functionality** is particularly important but requires a deep understanding of the package:
    - Examine the repo thoroughly to understand the full breadth of what it does
    - Be exhaustive; try not to miss any functionality
16. **Related Region** is also important and requires a deep understanding of the physical regions the software is commonly used for.

Many fields are domain-specific (heliophysics) and may require understanding of the software's scientific purpose, which might be found in papers, documentation, or descriptive text in the README.
